In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

    - Preprocess java dataset for code2seq
    - Train code2seq model (java-small & java-med)
    - Misprediction analysis with code2seq
    - Scalability of misprediction for code2seq
    - Update results with permute statement from next pair to all pairs
    - kconfig: Creduce with the invocation of gcc and clang to avoid undefiend behaviors
  
02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

    writing: https://www.overleaf.com/3253591763cvkfdzbnfhsj
    coding: /scratch/rabin/ISSTA/code2seq/
  
03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 

    TNPA: https://www.overleaf.com/3253591763cvkfdzbnfhsj
    
04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 
    
    /scratch/rabin/ISSTA/code2seq/preprocess_transformation
    /scratch/rabin/ISSTA/code2seq/predict_transformation
    /scratch/rabin/ISSTA/code2seq/mispredict_scalability
    
05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.  
    
    /scratch/rabin/ISSTA/code2seq/data/preprocess-transformation/
    /scratch/rabin/ISSTA/code2seq/models/
    
06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  
    
    1. Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate
    2. code2seq: Generating Sequences from Structured Representations of Code
    
07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 
  
    Talked with Amin for Creduce and Nghi for GGNN VarNaming.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

    Following productivity tips of researchers: 
    https://www.academictransfer.com/en/blog/20-productivity-tips-for-researchers/.
    
09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

    Detecting unique number of gcc bugs for kconfig.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

    I have to write some papers' summary that I already read.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

    - Summarize findings from result section
    - PermuteStatement (all pairs) for C#

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

    - Not for next week
