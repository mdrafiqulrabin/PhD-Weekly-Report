07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 
  
    Not applicable for this week.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

    Being more proactive and innovative.

09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

    The GGNN should be re-looked.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

    Yeah, absolutely.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

  - Check if a private method is not used in the same Java class
  - Extract Single Method from C# file
  - Build GGNN Tool

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

  - ProGuard, Ant, GGNN
