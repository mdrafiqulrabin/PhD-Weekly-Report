In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

    - Prepossessing C (remove comments)
    - C to AST (dump AST from C, ignore errors or macros only)
    - Prepossessing AST (remove errors and header typedef)
    - Args Count (count all the occurrence of features)
    - Prepossessing CSV (remove zero rows/cols and normalize value)
    - X-means clustering on args_normalized csv
  
02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

    - Min-Max Normalization (y= (x-min)/(max-min))
    - X-Means (pyclustering.cluster.xmeans)
  
03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 

    - ASE-19-LBR: https://www.overleaf.com/project/5d263a59cf7d6d362d573c73

04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 

    - C2AST, Prepossessings, ArgsCount, X-means: https://trello.com/c/3SrhYB7r/33-args-count-from-clang-ast
    
05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.  

    - ArgsCount: https://trello.com/c/3SrhYB7r/33-args-count-from-clang-ast
    
06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  

    - Learning to Prioritize Test Programs for Compiler Testing
    - Coverage Prediction for Accelerating Compiler Testing

07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 
  
    Think so.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

    Needs some initiative for compiler testing submission.

09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

    Some C programs don't have Csmith features, there for results in all zero rows. 
    In preporocessing phase, this should be removed before normalization.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

    Seems good.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

  - Features change in gcc bug reports
  - Manual vs Automated features in bugs
  - COP/LET dataset

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

  - X-means, Bug reports.
