In the past week:

    1. [SERG - Presentation]:  Dynamic Slicing for Deep Neural Networks [ESEC/FSE  2020]
    2. [DD-Model] Fixed the loss issue - problem with dataset

Plan for the next week:

    1. [DD-Model] Fix the loss issue - keep method name
    2. [DD-Model] Run for code2seq - reduce sum loss
