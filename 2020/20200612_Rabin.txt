In the past week: 

  - HFE:
    - Added new features based on code complexity (now total = 53)
    - Train SVMLight on updated feature list
  - Extension of Generalizability:
    1) Run CSharpExtractor
        - Install dotnetcore 2.2.0 in server
        - Add full path in CSharpExtractor
        - Unknown write issue in parallel threading 
        - Preprocess CSharp dataset
    2) Split CSharp MS Data (24 projects):
        - Separate methods from .cs file
        - Train/Val/Test split by projects (poor training performance)
        - Stratified split by methods (better training performance)
    3) More CSharp Transformations:
        - Permute-Statement (basic block)
        - Log-Statement-Insertion
        - Reorder-Condition
        - Try-Catch-Insertion

Plan for the next weeks: 

  - Study papers on Generalizability vs Memorization
  
  
Extra Task:
  - TA Soft Design: Assignment-1, grading for 22 groups.
