In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

    - c2s: save flat embeddings (200*320) from code2seq
    - c2s: apply pca to get reduced dimension (n=1000)
    - c2s: run 5 algorithms using StratifiedKFold and GridSerachCV
    - c2v: save flat embeddings (200*384) from code2vec
    - c2v: apply pca to get reduced dimension (n=1000)
    - c2v: run 5 algorithms using StratifiedKFold and GridSerachCV
    - adding results and tSNE into overleaf 
    
02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

    - N/A
  
03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 
    
    https://www.overleaf.com/project/5e61d3179efa760001de1ea8
    
04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 
    
    code2seq: /scratch/rabin/pca/uhserg-pca/code2seq
    code2vec: /scratch/rabin/pca/uhserg-pca/code2vec
    
05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.  
    
    data: /scratch/rabin/pca/uhserg-pca/data
    result: /scratch/rabin/pca/uhserg-pca/result
    
06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  
    
     I have not read any paper but has plan to read.
    
07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 
  
    Things was going as per plan.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

    Following productivity tips of researchers: 
    https://www.academictransfer.com/en/blog/20-productivity-tips-for-researchers/.
    
09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

    Things was going as per plan.
    
10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

    Yes.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

    - Select top20 frequent methods
    - Handcrafted feature extractions for top20
    - Build handcrafted java extractor for top20
    - Dataset with top20 methods from java-large
    - Training/Validation/Test split instead of K-Fold
    - Only code2vec using code_vectors (384 dimension)
    - Multilabel classification for handcrafted

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

    - Multilabel classification
