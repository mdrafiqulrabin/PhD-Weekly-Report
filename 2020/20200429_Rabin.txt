In the past week: 

- ASE20 Submission (Working 90%+ of time for ASE submission + with Nghi for path fixing and GGNN data analysis)
- NLP Project (Worked on char and word embedding on Friday and Saturday)
- Issue: Can't manage time for handcrafted features, perhaps after ASE submission.

Plan for the next weeks: 

- ASE20 Submission (table + figure for GGNN and text update in overleaf)
- NLP project finishing (token embedding) + report writing
