In the past week: 

    1. dd-code2seq for prediction and loss
    2. code-captioning task on code2seq:
      2.1. Extract codenn csharp SO dataset
      2.2. Preprocess codenn csharp SO dataset
      2.2. Training dd-code2seq on code-captioning task

Plan for the next weeks: 

    1. apply dd-code2seq on code-captioning task
    2. apply dd-code2vec on code-captioning task
    3. save timestamp during dd simplification
    4. think about some RQs
