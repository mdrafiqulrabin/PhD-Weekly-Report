In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

    - split loss by half and train two ensemble model
    - adding percentage of bar on histogram
    - 7 histogram by splitting loss [0~10, 11~20, ...]
    - change of loss (bettter/worse) between best 3 epoch
    - distribution of labels in part1/part2 compared to main
    - change of loss in part1/part2 compared to main
    - ensemble on taking 10% from train as val
  
02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

    - CS Seminar: Clustering: Basic Approaches and Their Evaluation
    - Journal Club - AI for software engineering
  
03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 

    Currently we're experimenting on ensemble with loss.
    
04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 
    
    script: https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/fork2-code2seq
    
05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.  
    
    result: /scratch/rabin/ensemble/fork2-code2seq/ensemble
    
06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  
    
     1. Adversarial Sample Detection for Deep Neural Network through Model Mutation Testing
    
07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 
  
    Everything was going as per plan.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

    Following productivity tips of researchers:

09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

    Everything was going as per plan.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

    Yes.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

    - complexity and confidence matrix
    - pca embedding and tsne of c2v
    - merge dataset after filtering by size and frequency
    - training on merge data for losses
    - summary and histogram on merge data

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

    - N/A
