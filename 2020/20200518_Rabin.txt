  
In the past week: 

- Handcrafted multi-classification:  
    1. c2v + SVM
    2. char_ascii + GRU
    
- Handcrafted binary-classification:  
    1. Setup SVMLight (C binaries) 
    2. Split data for binary-classification
    3. Dump svm-light file format
    4. Train models for HFE(binary, norm) and code2vec
    5. Add code2vec + HFE together and train model
    6. Check stability of code2vec embedding multiple dump

Plan for the next weeks: 

- Journal Extension:
    1. Update CSharpTransformer
    2. Check CSharpExtractor
    
- Generalization vs Memorization:
    1. Read paper
    2. Brainstorming
