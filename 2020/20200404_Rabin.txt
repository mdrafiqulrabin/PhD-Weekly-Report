In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 
    - Perform deduplication for java-large
    - Binary classification using deduplication java-large-test [K-Fold]
    - Handcrafted features for multi-classification [top11]
    - Training/Validation/Test split instead of K-Fold
    - Training SVM for multi-classification with all samples [top11] (still running)
    - Training SVM for multi-classification with 1K train per label [top11]
    - code2vec with all samples and 1K train per label [top11]

02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

    - SVM and Deduplication
  
03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 
    
    https://www.overleaf.com/project/5e61d3179efa760001de1ea8
    
04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 
    
    /scratch/rabin/pca/uhserg-pca/handcrafted
    
05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.  
    
    data: /scratch/rabin/pca/uhserg-pca/data
    result: /scratch/rabin/pca/uhserg-pca/result
    
06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  
    
     - Semantic Robustness of Models of Source Code 
    
07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 

    - Yes, discussing in group meetings

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

    Following productivity tips of researchers: 
    https://www.academictransfer.com/en/blog/20-productivity-tips-for-researchers/.
    
09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

    - code2vec outperforming SVM, planning to extend features
    
10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

    Yes.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

    - Related literature study
    - reduce code2vec dimension to handcrafted dimension [i.e. 384 to 39]
    - improve handcrafted featutes to improve score [i.e. execute, run]

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

    - Related literature study
