In the past week: 

    Experiment of memorization using SA (sorting algorithm) dataset:

    1. Startified shuffling 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of method name.
    2. Training models for each shuffled partitions and save data.
    3. Plots for training and validation prediction, loss, gini, f1/accuracy.

Plan for the next weeks: 

    1. Overleaf for memorization and hf.
    2. Setup procedure for GGNN.
