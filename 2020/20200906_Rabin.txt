In the past week: 

    1. Kconfig SAC-SVT submission
    2. Delta debugging for handcrafted-svm
    3. Delta debugging for code2vec model

Plan for the next weeks: 

    1. Select 50 * 10 most occuring correctly predicted methods from Java Large
    2. Apply delta debugging to get simplified methods for them
