In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

  - Machine Learning Final Mid-Term
  - Apply prediction on java-small/test dataset for code2vec
  
02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

    Computer Science Distinguished Seminar
    Topic: A Practical Unstructured Spline Modeling Platform for Isogeometric Analysis Applications
  
03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 

    N/A
    
04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 

    Link: /scratch/rabin/tool/code2vec/interactive_predict.py
    
05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.  
    
    Link: /scratch/rabin/tool/code2vec/predict
    
06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  
    
    1. AutoFocus: Interpreting Attention-based Neural Networks by Code Perturbation
    
07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 
  
    Yes, whenever needed.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

    Learning deep neural model.
    
09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

    Prediction code is running in sequence with tmux, for 1 project it spent more than 24h!
    It could happen for large size of project, I will see few more projects over weekend.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

    Following 20 Productivity Tips: https://www.academictransfer.com/en/blog/20-productivity-tips-for-researchers/.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

    - [continuing] Apply prediction on test dataset for code2vec
    - Machine Learning Final Project Submission

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

  - communication and writting
