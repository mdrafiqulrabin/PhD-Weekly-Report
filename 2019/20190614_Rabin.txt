In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

  [Research]
  - How to load the NN models from tf checkpoint [https://trello.com/c/gA7R1WRa/17-load-the-nn-models-from-tf-checkpoint]
  - Run the code2vec tool (GitHub) [https://trello.com/c/wdEXXsjt/20-run-the-code2vec-tool-github]
  - Preprocess java files with code2vec JavaExtractor [https://trello.com/c/xO1Kly8T/9-preprocess-java-files-with-code2vec-javaextractor]
  - Test code2vec with demo java files [https://trello.com/c/W1pmFGxX/21-test-code2vec-with-demo-java-files]
  - Transformation strategy on the code2vec demo java files [https://trello.com/c/vHReCYmy/8-transformation-strategy-on-the-code2vec-demo-java-files]
  
  [Course]
  - Cluster Computing: Introduction to HPC and Bash Shell
  - Machine Learning: Application of Machine learning
  
02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

  - Introduction to Deep Learning [https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/week/1]
  - Logistic Regression as a Neural Network [https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/week/2]

03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 

    N/A

04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 

    - preprocess_java.sh [https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/fork-code2vec/blob/master/preprocess_java.sh]
    - code2vec_java.sh [https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/fork-code2vec/blob/master/code2vec_java.sh]
    
05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.  

    - Demo .java & .c2v files [https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/fork-code2vec/tree/master/data_java/demo11]
    
06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  

    code2vec: learning distributed representations of code
    https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/Paper-Summary/blob/master/Summer-2019/20190613_rabin.txt

07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 

  of course: by email or by chat, i.e. AST to JSON issue, GPU issue in sabine HPC cluster, etc.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

  By running the code2vec tool.

09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

  Script is not executing in sabine HPC cluster for not getting gpu based compute node.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

  Hope so.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

  [Research]
  - Learning Distributed Representations of Code : code2vec
  - Transformation strategy on the code2vec demo java files
  
  [Course]
  - Summer CACDS: Machine Learning and Cluster Computing.
  - Coursera: Python & Vectorization(2/4)

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

  - Bash Shell, Transformation.
