In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

  - [COSC 8398 - Doctoral Research]
    - Try to install the 'trunk' version of GCC.
    - Optimization levels testing with swarm arguments.
    - Optimization levelS testing with probability to arguments for k10.
    - Check the crashes bug in gcc regression testsuite. 
    - Read 2 papers and write summaries.
  - [COSC 6323 - Statistical Methods]:
    - Study about Statistical Hypothesis Test.
    - Learn R on Statistics: critical value, test statistic, significance level, z-score, p-value.
  - [COSC 6385 - Computer Architecture]:
    - Study about Multi-core Performance Evaluation.
  - [COSC 4315/6345 - Programming Languages]:
    - Attend to the classes and TA hours.
    - Study about variable binding and scoping.
    - Random e-meeting with students for HW1 and Kodethon setup.

02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

  - Not anything really in this week except the research and course works.

03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 

    Adding result of the optimization levels testing between -O0 and -O3 (3 times) for 12 hrs in Sabine: 
      - result.tex (table-2&4): GCC(4.8.0/5.4.0) with swarm arguments.
      - result.tex (table-3&5): GCC(4.8.0/5.4.0) with probability to arguments for k10.

07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 

  - Search google to fix the trunk version GCC install issue "make: *** [all] Error 2" (not solved).

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

  - Was not effective: miss one seminar and was late in weekly group meeting.

09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

  - Couldn't able to install trunk version of GCC, will look again.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

  - Solve some programming problems in Hackerrank.
  - Hope to install trunk version of GCC.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

  - Try to install the 'trunk' version of GCC.
  - Fork DARPA and setup the configuration for the forkdarpa.
  - Setup the configuration for the forkdeepsmith.
  - Study about Branch Prediction and HW1 of [COSC 6385 - Computer Architecture].
  - Study about Ref Paper and Test Data of [COSC 6323 - Statistical Methods].
  - Study about HW2 and Project(Fig.3) of [COSC 6323 - Statistical Methods].
  - Attend to all class course and ta hours.

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

  - Install and use 'dplyr' package in R Studio for unstructure data.
  - Trend graph and Boxplot in Latex report with R Sweave.
