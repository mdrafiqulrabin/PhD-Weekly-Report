07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 

  Yes.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

  By managing task in time.

09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

  Nothing visible.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

  Seems good.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

  - [COSC 8398 - Doctoral Research] 
    - Add the Survey paper in Overleaf.
    - Related works of CSmith in Overleaf.
    - Think about test case line Ranking.
  - [COSC 4315/6345 - Programming Languages]
    - Grading for HW3.

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

  - Basic Haskell programming.
