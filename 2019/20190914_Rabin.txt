In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

    - Listing the DNN papers (title, authors, link, task, etc)
    - Analysis the result of kconfig over swarm
    - Adding the result of kconfig in Overleaf
    - Run default/swarm/kconfig with 1 min timeout
  
02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

    - Reading: Concept Learning and Probabilistic Learning
    - Writing: Finding the Location of Objects in Indoor Environments Using Ultra-Wideband Radios
  
03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 

    - Result of kconfig in Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/project/5d641bb21a2e616c968728c9).

04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 

    - kconfig: /project/alipour/rabin/kconfig/scripts
    
05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.  
    
    - kconfig: /project/alipour/rabin/kconfig/data
    
06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  
    
    - Code Vectors: Understanding Programs Through Embedded Abstracted Symbolic Traces
    - Import2vec: Learning Embeddings for Software Libraries
    
07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 
  
    I talked with colleagues for issues and ideas.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

    By collaboration and time managment.
    
09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

    I read but missed paper writing for HW submission. I plan to write those by Monday.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

    I hope so.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

  - Try with GGNN and report error if any
  - Analysis function coverage from csmith configuration
  - Revised the writing of K-CONFIG paper

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

  - Octave for Machine Learning
