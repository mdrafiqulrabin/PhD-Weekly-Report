In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

    - Build GCC trunk version in Sabine
    - Run swarm in trunk version for 24 hours
    - Run default/swarm/kconfig in gcc trunk version for 6 hours
    - Run default/swarm/kconfig in gcc trunk version with 10K tc
  
02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

    - Multivariate Linear Regression
    - Gradient descent and Cost function
  
03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 

    - Data collecting for Revised K-CONFIG paper (/project/alipour/rabin/kconfig).

04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 

    - Run with gcc trunk for 6h and 10K: /project/alipour/rabin/kconfig/scripts
    
05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.  

    - Swarm in gcc trunk: /project/alipour/rabin/kconfig/swarm24h
    
06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  

    - Code Vectors: Understanding Programs Through Embedded Abstracted Symbolic Traces

07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 
  
    I have not faced any blocking issues this week.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

    By scheduling an appointment to UH writing center for writing tips.
    
09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

    Not really as working on revised K-CONFIG.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

    I think so.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

  - Machine Learning Assignment #1 Due
  - Graduate Colloquium Writing #1 Due
  - Revised the writing of K-CONFIG paper
  - Listing the DNN papers (title, authors, link, task, etc)

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

  - Octave for Machine Learning
