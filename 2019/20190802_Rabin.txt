In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

  - Transformation: permuting the order of statements
  - Transformation with C# Parser
  
02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

    Play with dotnet-roslyn: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn
  
03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 

  - Testing neural program (https://www.overleaf.com/project/5d263a59cf7d6d362d573c73)

04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 

    - PermuteStatement: https://trello.com/c/yggjHBIE/35-transformation-permuting-the-order-of-statements
    - CSharpTransformer: https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/CSharpTransformer/tree/master/src
    
05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.  

    - CSharpTransformer: https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/CSharpTransformer/
    
06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  

    N/A (because of summer trip)

07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 
  
    Of course, always inform when needs.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

    Being more proactive and innovative.

09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

    I got issues with GGNN and will re-look again, otherwise should email to authors.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

    Yeah, absolutely.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

  - Build GGNN Tool
  - Generate Transformed Dataset

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

  - GGNN, JavaTransformer, CSharpTransformer
