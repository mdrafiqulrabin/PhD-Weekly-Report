In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

    - Revised the k-config paper writing (for setup.tex and evaluation.tex).
    - Update proofread feedback of Testing neural program analyzers paper.
    - Apply n-gram (n=1~5) with 30K test cases .
    - Details study on Code Vectors paper.
    - Apply n-gram (n=1~5) with 10K test cases.
  
02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

    - Presentation on Code Vectors paper.
  
03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 

    - k-config paper: https://www.overleaf.com/project/5d641bb21a2e616c968728c9

04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 

    - n-gram: /project/alipour/rabin/kconfig/ngram
    
05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.  
    
    - n-gram: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17QD4Fwk-NdhLpv_03xz24_-6q3KaFqP2HHfxOmi1oCA/edit#gid=0
    
06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  
    
    - Code Vectors: Understanding Programs Through Embedded Abstracted Symbolic Traces
    - Scalable Approaches for Test Suite Reduction
    - DeepFuzz: Automatic Generation of Syntax Valid C Programs for Fuzz Testing
    
07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 
  
    I talked with colleagues for issues and ideas.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

    By collaboration and time managment.
    
09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

    Waiting for lab server to run GGNN.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

    I aim to follow this 20 Productivity Tips for research (https://www.academictransfer.com/en/blog/20-productivity-tips-for-researchers/).

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

  - Statistical test among features of test suite
  - Revised the writing of K-CONFIG paper
  - ML midterm (Oct 2) and neural based HW (Oct 4).
  - Task breakdown for testing neural program analyzer

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

  - Machine Learning: IDE - Jupyter Notebook, Topics - Perceptron.
