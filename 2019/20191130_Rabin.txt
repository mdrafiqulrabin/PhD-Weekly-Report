In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

  - Prediction (interactive) of code2vec on transformation for java-small and java-med
  
02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

    Working on ISSTA submission
  
03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper

04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 

    Link: /scratch/rabin/ISSTA/fork2-code2vec/interactive_predict.py
    
05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.

06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  
    
    No planned paper to read.
    
07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 
  
    Yes, whenever needed.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

    Learning graph neural model.
    
09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

    Prediction should be in batch.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher?

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

    - Predict java-large with batch
    - Machine Learning Final Project Submission

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

  No plan for next week.
