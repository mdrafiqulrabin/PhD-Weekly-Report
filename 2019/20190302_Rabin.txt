02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

  Go through the abstract and introduction of papers:
  - Generalized data structure synthesis
  - Guiding dynamic symbolic execution toward unverified program executions

  Seminar: Blockchain: Transforming Global Supply Chain Security

03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 

    N/A

04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 

  Draw XD links and KDirect/KMediated histogram:
  - Fig 2B: https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/sm-xd-evolution/blob/master/Fig2B.R
  - Fig S2: https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/sm-xd-evolution/blob/master/FigS2.R
       
05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.  

  Extract data for Direct/Mediated links of faculty co-authors:

  - Fig2B_Mediated: https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/sm-xd-evolution/tree/master/CSV/Fig2B_Mediated
    
06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  

    - Paper-01: DeepFuzz: Automatic Generation of Syntax Valid C Programs for Fuzz Testing
      Link: https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/Paper-Summary/blob/master/Spring-2019/20190228_rabin.txt
    - Paper-02: Guiding dynamic symbolic execution toward unverified program executions
      Link: https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/Paper-Summary/blob/master/Spring-2019/20190301_rabin.txt

07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 

  - Searching google in case of any difficulties. 
  - Knocking professor for guideline when getting stuck.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

  - Run and show the output of DeepSmith.

09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

  - Facing difficulties to understand the code of Deepsmith.
    - Start implementing tools from Scratch.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

  - Attend seminars on time.
  - Actively participate in research group talk.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

  - List down the compiler/interpreter testing paper published in good conferences.
  - Understanding LSTM and its implementation in Keras.
  - Programming assignment: Branch Prediction [COSC 6385 - Computer Architecture].
  - Project Figure (2a and S1) and Report [COSC 6323 - Statistical Methods].
  - Attend to all class course and ta hours.

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

  - Gephi visualization
