07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 

  - Search google for random bash script syntax.
  - Talk with Steve about the problem regarding Kodethon account with uh email.
  - Talk with TA of [COSC 6323 - Statistical Methods] about data.frame-factor.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

  - I submitted weekly report on time although I had planned trip to Dallas at that time.

09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

  - Wanted to play with DeepSmith in this week but somehow forwarded to next week.
  - 1 paper summary writting is pending, will finish within this weekend.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

  - Discussed with colleague how to collect SO data by REST API.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

  - Sabine: Run scripts for 12 hours with round-robin selection of arguments for default,k3 and k10.
  - DeepSmith: Create Fork-DeepSmith repo from original DeepSmith and play with it.
  - Study about Pipeline techniques of [COSC 6385 - Computer Architecture].
  - Study about Probability and Sampling Distributions of [COSC 6323 - Statistical Methods].
  - Add studets to Kodethon and Publish an Assignment0 for studets.
  - Attend to all class course and ta hours.

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

  - Play with Itertools of Python in HackerRank.
  - Install and load packages in RStudio.
