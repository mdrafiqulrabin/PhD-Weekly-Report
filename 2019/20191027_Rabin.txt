In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

    - Extract method from java projects
    - Filter java function if "no diff" after transformation
    - Apply java transformation in one place at a time
    - methods to c2v using c2v-parser
    - Prediction on transformation with code2vec
  
02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

    N/A
  
03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 

    - PLDI Submission 2019
    
04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 

    Link: /scratch/rabin/tnpa
    
05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.  
    
    Link: /scratch/rabin/data/code2vec
    
06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  
    
    1. Adversarial Examples for Models of Code
    
07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 
  
    Yes, continuously asking for PLDI.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

    By digging inside extracting tool.
    
09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

    Need to figure out the extractor for GGNN.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher?
