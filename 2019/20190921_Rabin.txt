In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

    - Collect data of DNN models
    - Apply creduce to kconfig bugs
    - Function coverage analysis
  
02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

    - Google Journal Club: Scalable Approaches for Test Suite Reduction
  
03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 

    Didn't work on paper writing directly.

04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 

    - creduce: /project/alipour/rabin/kconfig/scripts/creduce
    - coverage analysis: /project/alipour/gcc-installations/analysis
    
05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.  
    
    - DNN models: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hAUvX_Ss795ddAFzFc5NVlonhRJVH1R-oIHnP1n5rRI/edit#gid=0
    - creduce: /project/alipour/rabin/kconfig/data/creduce
    - coverage analysis: /project/alipour/gcc-installations/analysis
    
06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  
    
    - 500+ Times Faster Than Deep Learning
    - Scalable Approaches for Test Suite Reduction
    
07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 
  
    I talked with colleagues for issues and ideas.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

    By collaboration and time managment.
    
09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

    I plan to complete all pending task by tomorrow.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

    I hope so.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

  - Analysis ongoing function coverage
  - Try with GGNN and report error if any
  - Revised the writing of K-CONFIG paper

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

  - SVM+DT for Machine Learning
  - LSTM for Deep Learning
