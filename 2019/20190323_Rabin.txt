07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 

  - Search Stack Overflow and Youtube for installing Linux in VirtualBox on OSX.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

  - Manage high volume submissions alongside research works.

09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

  N/A for this week. 

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

  Nothing seems unproductive!

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)
