In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

  [Research]
  - Code Study of JavaExtractor: https://trello.com/c/OcDRnhQr/26-source-code-study-of-javaextractor
  - Tree Traversal with Java Parser Visitor: https://trello.com/c/suRWA2P2/28-tree-traversal-of-java-parser-with-visitor
  - Code to transform: Variable Renaming and Boolean Exchange
  
  [Course]
  - Cluster Computing: SLURM & Bash script.
  - Machine Learning: Image Classification with KMeans and PCA.
  - Coursera: Python & Vectorization [2/4].
  
02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

  - Inspecting an AST: https://javaparser.org/inspecting-an-ast/
  - Analyzing Java Code programmatically: https://tomassetti.me/getting-started-with-javaparser-analyzing-java-code-programmatically/
  
03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 

    N/A

04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 

    - Code to transform the variable renaming: https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/JavaTransformer/blob/master/src/main/java/VariableRenaming.java
    - Code to transform the boolean exchange: https://trello.com/c/ZAAA1Vxz/29-code-to-transform-the-boolean-exchange
    
05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.  

    - Online code2vec demo [https://code2vec.org/]
    
06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  

    N/A

07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 

  Nothing in this week.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

  Performed two (variable renaming and boolean exchange) transformation.

09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

  Node insertion or update in tree of java parser.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

  Hope so.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

  [Research]
  - Spoon tool for transformation (variable renaming or boolean exchange)
  - Code to transform the loop exchange (i.e. while to for)
  
  [Course]
  - Summer CACDS Quiz: Cluster Computing.
  - Coursera: Python & Vectorization [3/4]

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

  - SLRUM, Spoon Transformation.
