In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

    - Generate centroids with X-Means by probability thresholds
    - Generate 10K tc with csmith for default, random and config
    - Build gcc 6.1.0, 7.1.0, 8.1.0, 9.1.0 in Sabine
    - Run default/swarm/kconfig 10k tc in gcc 4.8.2, 5.4.0, 6.1.0 ... 9.1.0
  
02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

    Reading:
    - Finding the Maximally Specific Hypothesis
    - Version Space of Candidate Elimination Algorithm
  
03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 

    - working on the revised K-CONFIG paper.

04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 

    - csmith_n.sh: https://trello.com/c/Niy6QCVU/40-revision-task
    - gcc_n.sh: https://trello.com/c/Niy6QCVU/40-revision-task
    
05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.  

    - csmith_n.sh: https://trello.com/c/Niy6QCVU/40-revision-task
    - gcc_n.sh: https://trello.com/c/Niy6QCVU/40-revision-task
    
06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  

    - DeepHunter: A Coverage-Guided Fuzz Testing Framework for Deep Neural Networks.

07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 
  
    Always.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

    Needs some initiative for research work.
    
09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

    Not really as working on revised K-CONFIG.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

    Sure, I am on it.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

  - Run default/swarm/kconfig tc in gcc for 6 hours
  - Revised the writing of K-CONFIG paper

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

  - Not really as working on revised K-CONFIG
