In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

  - Put result of the Csmith differential testing (table-1) at overleaf.
  - Install gcc compilers into Sabine.
  - Read and write summaries of 3 papers.
  - Present an interesting paper in team group meeting.
  - Attend to Architecture, Statistics and Programming languages course.

02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

  - Reading & Writing: This information has been given in question no 06.
  - Presentation: https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/Paper-Summary/blob/master/Presentation/20190118_Rabin.pptx
  - Coding & Result: This information has been given in question no 04 & 05.

03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 

  - Result of differential testing at local pc: result.tex (table-1): https://www.overleaf.com/9713562856nbbcwgbqnhvz

04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 

  - Differential testing at local pc: https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/Doctoral-Research/blob/master/differential_testing/pcmac_csmith/pc_csmith_args.sh
  - Differential testing at maxwell: https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/Doctoral-Research/blob/master/differential_testing/maxwell_csmith/mw_csmith_args.sh

05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.  

  - Result of differential testing at local pc: https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/Doctoral-Research/tree/master/differential_testing/pcmac_csmith/save_data/
  - Result of differential testing at maxwell: https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/Doctoral-Research/tree/master/differential_testing/maxwell_csmith/save_data/

06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  

  - Paper-01: Compiler Fuzzing through Deep Learning: https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/Paper-Summary/blob/master/Spring-2019/20190115_rabin.txt
  - Paper-02: A Snowballing Literature Study on Test Amplification: https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/Paper-Summary/blob/master/Spring-2019/20190116_rabin.txt
  - Paper-03: Evaluating Fuzz Testing: https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/Paper-Summary/blob/master/Spring-2019/20190117_rabin.txt

07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 

  Yes, mostly check on the internet first.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

  - Should arrive on time at the class/meeting or whatever.
  - Should not keep task for tomorrow.

09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

  - Spending lots of time to read a paper -> 2 hours is enough for each paper.
  - Having problem to align text in overleaf -> Put the content first, we can fix everything later.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

  We should on track always, please guide us to be a productive researcher.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

  - Sabine:
    1st run: Create c programs by Csmith and execute with gcc 4.8.2 -O3 for 6 hours.
    2nd run: Execute c programs generated in 1st run with gcc 4.8.2 -O0 and comapre result with -O3.
  - DeepSmith:
    Clone from Github and try to run and check.
    Then check how to use c files of linux kernel for DeepSmith modeling.

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

  - Basic R script
  - LaTex writing
