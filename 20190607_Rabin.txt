In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

  - Build the Ke C# Parser
  - Generate AST from C# program (Roslyn API)
  - Coursera: Introduction to Deep Learning

02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

  - Cosine Similarity: https://www.machinelearningplus.com/nlp/cosine-similarity/
  - Vector Representations of Words: https://israelg99.github.io/2017-03-22-Vector-Representations-of-Words/
  - Introduction to SysML: https://trello.com/c/GXGzEZBW/1-introduction-to-sysml

03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 

    N/A

04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 
    
    N/A
    
05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.

07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 

  of course: by email or by chat.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

  Doing a task (Generating AST with Roslyn API).

09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

  Generating AST with Ke C# Parser (right now paused as we will get the required json data).

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

  by all means!

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

  - Apply COSET Transformation on Sample Programs.
  - Study the json data provided by Ke and Train the model.
  - Summer session: Machine learning and Cluster Computing.
  - Coursera: Logistic Regression as a Neural Network(1/4)

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

  - COSET Transformation.
