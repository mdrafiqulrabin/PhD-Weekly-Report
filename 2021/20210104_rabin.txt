In the past week:

    1. [DD-Model] - check IG approach for code2vec/code2seq
                  - code-vectors are the aggregation of all path-contexts with attention scores
                  - work in progress, still didn't find way to adopt for code2vec/code2seq
                  
    2. [DD-Model] - check attention score to highlight AST path
                      - extract path-context using extractor
                      - collect attention-score given by models to each path
                      - select topk AST path based on attention score
                  - points to be noted
                      - code2seq: attention score for each sub-token prediction
                      - code2vec: AST path instead of hash value

Plan for the next week:

    1. [DD-Model] - DD/Perses on rare method names
                    - find rare method names: less frequent or p <= 0.5
                    - run DD/Perses on rare method names 
    
    2. [DD-Model] - Overleaf draft
