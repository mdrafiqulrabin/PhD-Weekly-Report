In the past week:

    1. [DD-code2x] - DD/Perses on rare method names
                   - find rare method names: less frequent or p <= 0.5
                   - run DD/Perses on rare method names
                   - fix issues for code2vec, re-run everything again!

    2. [DD-Great] - train RNN for few steps for testing purpose
                  - create a demo output for VM task
                    - [a] first, DD shouldn't not remove tokens at "error_loc, repair_targets, repair_candidates" positions,
                    - [b] second, update the index of "error_loc, repair_targets, repair_candidates" when DD removes some tokens.
                    
    3. SERG - Weekly Presentation
                  - Infercode paper by Nghi D. Q. Bui

Plan for the next week:

    1. [DD-Great] - run DD for VM task using RNN and Transformer
