  - Install gcc compilers into Sabine.
  - Read and write summaries of 3 papers.
  - Present an interesting paper in team group meeting.
  - Attend to Architecture, Statistics and Programming languages course.

02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

  - Reading & Writing: This information has been given in question no 06.

07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next week’s objectives (be as specific as possible)

  - Sabine:
    1st run: Create c programs by Csmith and execute with gcc 4.8.2 -O3 for 6 hours.
    2nd run: Execute c programs generated in 1st run with gcc 4.8.2 -O0 and comapre result with -O3.
  - DeepSmith:
    Clone from Github and try to run and check.
    Then check how to use c files of linux kernel for DeepSmith modeling.

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

  - Basic R script
  - LaTex writing
