07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 
  
    Yes, whenever needed.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

    Learning graph neural model.
    
09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them?

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

    - Scalability of misprediction
    - Training regime to 100 epochs
    - Put examples of transformation in overleaf
    - Read paper and check code for code2seq

12. Any skill that you want to practice?
