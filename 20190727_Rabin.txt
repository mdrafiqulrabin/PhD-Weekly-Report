07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 

    I got issues with GGNN and reported to Dr. Amin.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

    By reading more articles.

09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

    Got issues with GGNN and will re-look again, otherwise should email to authors.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

    I am okay with this.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

  - Transformation: permuting the order of statements
  - Transformation with C# Parser

12. Any skill that you want to practice?
