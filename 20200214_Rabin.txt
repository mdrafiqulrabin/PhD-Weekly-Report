In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

    - Issues fixed for JavaExtractor related to method path
    - Issues fixed for Model on saving training loss
    - [java-small] Preprocess training dataset
    - [java-small] Save training loss with corresponding file path
    - Plot scatter and histogram, and details summary for top3 epoch.
  
02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

    - CS Seminar: Introduction to Neural Networks
  
03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 

    Currently we're experimenting on ensemble with loss.
    
04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 
    
    script: https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/fork2-code2seq
    
05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.  
    
    result: /scratch/rabin/ensemble/fork2-code2seq/ensemble
    
06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  
    
     Working on fixing issues with loss (also had double submission), didn't get chance to read papers.
    
07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 
  
    Yes, for getting single loss from sequence of loss by adding them.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

    Following productivity tips of researchers:

09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

    Having memory issues for java-large, we'll try be reducing heap size and thread.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

    Yes.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

    - Saving loss for validation same as training
    - Ensemble training after spliting dataset by loss

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

    - Nothing in plan
