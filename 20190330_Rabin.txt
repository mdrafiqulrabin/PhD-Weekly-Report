In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

  - [COSC 8398 - Doctoral Research] 
    - Study about Distance Matrix with mutant vectors.
    - Done with C based compiler testing papers' classification.

05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.  

  N/A for this week. 
    
06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.

07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 

  - Ask professor about difficulties of Distance-Metric paper.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

  N/A for this week. 

09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

  Nothing visible.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

  Not in this week for following reasons:
    - Read only one paper this week.
    - Paper summary was not based on own words.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next week’s objectives (be as specific as possible)

  - [COSC 8398 - Doctoral Research] 
    - Classify Java and JavaScript compiler testing related papers.
    - Check Android state-of-the-art testing tools.
    - Check Kotlin: open source project, library, test framework. 
    - Must Read Paper: Machine Learning Applied to Software Testing.
  - [COSC 6385 - Computer Architecture]
    - Programming Assignment 2: Demonstrate meltdown attack from github code.
  - [COSC 6323 - Statistical Methods]
    - Study about Dummy Variable Factor Effect.
    - Turn in project phase-II.
