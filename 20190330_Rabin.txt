In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

  - [COSC 8398 - Doctoral Research] 
    - Study about Distance Matrix with mutant vectors.
    - Done with C based compiler testing papers' classification.
  - [COSC 6385 - Computer Architecture]
    - Quiz 3 on memory and cache.
  - [COSC 6323 - Statistical Methods]
    - Work on project phase-II.
  - [COSC 4315/6345 - Programming Languages]
    - HW2 plagiarism checking.

02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

  Read the article 'Multi-Version Execution Defeats a Compiler-Bug-Based Backdoor':

05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.  

  N/A for this week. 
    
06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  

  - Paper-01: Causal Distance-Metric-Based Assistance for Debugging After Compiler Fuzzing
    Link: https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/Paper-Summary/blob/master/Spring-2019/20190325_rabin.txt

07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 

  - Ask professor about difficulties of Distance-Metric paper.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

  Writting paper summary by own words.

09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

  Nothing visible.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

  Not in this week for following reasons:
    - Read only one paper this week.
    - Paper summary was not based on own words.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

  - [COSC 8398 - Doctoral Research] 
    - Classify Java and JavaScript compiler testing related papers.
    - Check Android state-of-the-art testing tools.
    - Check Kotlin: open source project, library, test framework. 
    - Must Read Paper: Machine Learning Applied to Software Testing.
  - [COSC 6385 - Computer Architecture]
    - Programming Assignment 2: Demonstrate meltdown attack from github code.
  - [COSC 6323 - Statistical Methods]
    - Study about Dummy Variable Factor Effect.
    - Turn in project phase-II.
  - Attend to the classes, seminars, and ta hours.

12. Any skill that you want to practice?
