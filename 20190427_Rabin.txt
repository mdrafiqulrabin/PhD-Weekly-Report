01. Objectives for the week 

  - [COSC 8398 - Doctoral Research]: Technique and Evaluation of kmeans paper.
  - [COSC 6323 - Statistical Methods]: Learn about Time series.
  - [COSC 6385 - Computer Architecture: Learn about vector scheduling.
  - [TA] [COSC 4315/6345 - Programming Languages]: Grading for Quiz3 (Q1b,Q1c and Project) and uploading mark into BB.

02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on

06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  

    Read and check the structure of Technique and Evaluation of some fuzzing related papers to enhance the kmeans paper writing.

07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 

  Yes.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

  By managing task in time.

09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

  Nothing visible.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

  Seems good.
