In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

    - extract handcrafted features list for 100 random programs
    - featurs as binary and normalized count
    - t-SNE to visualize the handcrafted features list
    - visualize the embedding for the code2vec using t-SNE
  
02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

    - Study materials for SVM and t-SNE
  
03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 

    Currently we're experimenting with handcrafted features.
    
04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 
    
    script: /scratch/rabin/pca/
    
05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.  
    
    result: /scratch/rabin/pca/
    
06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  
    
     I had setup the new workstation (Ubuntu, Ethernet, CUDA, TF).
    
07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 
  
    Everything was going as per plan.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

    Following productivity tips of researchers:

09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

    Everything was going as per plan.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

    Yes.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

    - basic SVM to train the classifier with handcrafted features
    - run experiment with random 100 examples as non-target
    - SVM parameters optimization using GridSerachCV
    - SVM: handcrafted + c2v
    - plot 3d t-SNE and detect point in t_SNE

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

    - N/A
