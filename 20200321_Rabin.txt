In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

    - Handcrafted features for top11
    - JavaHandcraftedFeature extractor for top11
    - Dataset with top11 methods from java-large (all)
    - c2v features from pretrained java-large code2vec model
    - Startified K-Fold cross validation on handcrafted and c2v features
    
02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

    - PCA for feature reductions
  
03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 
    
    https://www.overleaf.com/project/5e61d3179efa760001de1ea8
    
04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 
    
    code2vec: /scratch/rabin/pca/uhserg-pca/code2vec
    
05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.  
    
    data: /scratch/rabin/pca/uhserg-pca/data
    result: /scratch/rabin/pca/uhserg-pca/result
    
06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  
    
     - Machine Learning Based Recommendation of Method Names: How Far Are We
     - Supervised Deep Feature Embedding With Handcrafted Feature
    
07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 
  
    Things were going as per plan.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

    Following productivity tips of researchers: 
    https://www.academictransfer.com/en/blog/20-productivity-tips-for-researchers/.
    
09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

    Things were going as per plan.
    
10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

    Yes.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

    - Dataset using java-large test set only
    - K-fold instead on Startified K-fold
    - Duplicate code detector using microsoft 
    - Experiment with top20 features

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

    - duplicate-code-detector
