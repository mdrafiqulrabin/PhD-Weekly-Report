In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

    - Abbreviation in Table
    - Average 3 run as a single (max) row
    - RQ1: default vs kconfig
    - RQ2: default vs swarm
    - RQ3: ngram
    - Distribution of features
    - Statistical test among features
  
02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

    - Libraries Events:
      1. Finding Data Workshop
      2. Core Data Management Practices for Researchers
    - Computer Science Seminar:
      1. Real Time Character Animation: Deformation, Rendering, and Beyond
      2. Towards Energy-Efficient Computing in Graphics Processing Units
  
03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 

    - k-config paper: https://www.overleaf.com/project/5d641bb21a2e616c968728c9

04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 

    - result analysis: /project/alipour/rabin/kconfig/analysis
    
05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.  
    
    - result analysis: /project/alipour/rabin/kconfig/analysis
    
06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  
    
    I didn't read any paper for ML midterm and K-Config result analysis.
    
07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 
  
    I talked with colleagues for issues and ideas.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

    By collaboration and time managment.
    
09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

    chi squared test doesn't work, so we will check coverage information.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher?

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

  - K-CONFIG paper: RQ
  - K-CONFIG paper: proof-read
  - K-CONFIG paper: coverage analysis
  - ML HW: Analysis of neural network (Sequential)

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

  - Machine Learning: Sequential Neural Network (Keras)
  - Gcov: GCC coverage analysis
