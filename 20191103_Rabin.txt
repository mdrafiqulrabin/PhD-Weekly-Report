In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

  - Train code2vec with java-large dataset (ongoing)
  - C# single methods extractor
  - C# transformation in single place
  
02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

    N/A
  
03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

    By digging inside extracting tool/model.
    
09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

    train code2vec, run GGNN model
