    N/A

04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 

    N/A
    
05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.

07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 

  Nothing in this week.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

  Code to apply the transform.

09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

  Script is not executing in sabine HPC cluster for not getting gpu based compute node.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

  Hope so.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)
