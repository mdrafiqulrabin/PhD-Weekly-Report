In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

  - Run transformations (VR & BE) on all java files
    https://trello.com/c/xDM3zCwa/31-run-transformations-vr-be-on-all-java-files
  - HPC Quiz and Job Scheduling Task.
  
02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

  - Spoon tool analysis (but having build issue)
  
03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 

    N/A

04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 

    - Code to apply transformation on all: https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/JavaTransformer/tree/master/src/main/java
    
05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.

07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 

  Nothing in this week.

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

  By reading more online materials.

09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

  - Build issue in Spoon tool.
  - Priority issue in sabine job.

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

  Hope so.

Plan for the next week: 

11. Next weekâ€™s objectives (be as specific as possible)

  [Research]
  - Observe the results after transformation
  - Spoon tool for transformation
  
  [Course]
  - ML Final Quiz.
  - ML Classification Task.

12. Any skill that you want to practice?

  - Sklearn classification models, Spoon again.
