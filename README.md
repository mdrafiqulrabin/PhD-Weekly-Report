# Weekly Progress Report 

Due:  Every Saturday 7 PM (except breaks and the week of paper submission) 

Commit YYYYMMDD_YOURNAME.txt file to your GitHub repo.  (contact me if you don’t have a repo) 

It is very easy to be carried away in the day to day tasks in the school and lose the larger picture of your research. Weekly reports allow you to frequently assess your progress and adjust your plans as needed. It would also allow me to evaluate your progress and provide assistance and feedback.  

It’s your life! Spend substantial time to reflect on what you have or have not done in a week and plan for the next week.  

In the weekly meeting report the following items.  

In the past week: 

01. Objectives for the week 

02. The research skills (e.g. reading/writing/presentation/coding...) worked on 

03. Papers that you worked on (writing/editing)?  Please add links to the paper 

04. Code you developed. Add links to the GitHub or Bitbucket repo. 

05. Analysis that you performed. Include link to the dataset and results.  

06. Include the names and summaries of papers you read.  

07. Did you seek help when you needed that? 

08. How could you increase your effectiveness by 1%. (e.g. writing scripts for some tasks, better organization, not doing some of the things that you did, etc.) 

09. Obstacles in you research and you plan to overcome them? 

10. Are you on track to be a productive researcher? 

Plan for the next week:
